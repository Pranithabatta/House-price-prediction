# House-price-prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging data science methodologies, this project aims to provide accurate estimations of house prices based on various features such as location, size, amenities, and other relevant factors.

Overview

Predicting house prices is a crucial task in real estate, finance, and urban planning. By employing advanced machine learning algorithms, this project aims to develop models capable of accurately predicting house prices. The models will be trained on historical data containing information about houses' attributes and their corresponding sale prices. Once trained, these models can be used to predict the prices of new or existing houses based on their features.

Features
* Data Collection: Gathering relevant data about houses, including features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, amenities, etc.
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure uniformity in the dataset.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between different features and their impact on house prices.
* Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
* Model Selection: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for predicting house prices based on the problem's nature and dataset characteristics.
* Model Training: Training selected models on the prepared dataset to learn patterns and relationships between features and target variables.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of trained models using relevant metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), etc.
* Model Deployment: Deploying the trained models to make predictions accessible through a user-friendly interface or API.
